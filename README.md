# MetacraftersSmartContractManagement
This project demonstrates a simple contract with 2-3 functions. This shows the values of those functions in frontend of the application.

# Description
Self-executing contracts, or smart contracts, operate on the decentralized and secure blockchain network of transactions. They can save expenses, risks, and errors by automating and streamlining contract management procedures.

# Getting Started
