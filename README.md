# MetacraftersSmartContractManagement
This project demonstrates a simple contract with 2-3 functions. This shows the values of those functions in frontend of the application.

# Description
Self-executing contracts, or smart contracts, operate on the decentralized and secure blockchain network of transactions. They can save expenses, risks, and errors by automating and streamlining contract management procedures.

# Getting Started
To help in doing this project, Sir Chris of Metacrafters provided a template https://github.com/MetacrafterChris/SCM-Starter. 
To use this you need to clone it first. After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
